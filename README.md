# Fougnigue-Sefon-MSCIS-Capstone-Portfolio
I am Fougnigue Sefon a MSCIS graduate from West Texas A&M University. This Repository contains my MSCIS capstone project and coursework artifacts across Data Analytics, Data Mining and Management, Systems Development, and Cybersecurity.

As a passionate and data-driven professional, I bring to the table a unique blend of skills in finance, economics, and now, CIS and Business Analytics. My deep understanding of the financial sector, coupled with my adeptness in data analysis and programming, empowers me to deliver practical solutions and valuable insights.

Having developed machine learning models, web applications, and data visualization dashboards, my strength lies in transforming complex data into actionable business strategies. Throughout my journey, I have developed expertise in numerous software such as Python, SQL, JavaScript, R, Tableau, RapidMiner, HTML, and CSS. My hands-on experience with these tools, combined with my strong determination, allow me to deliver high-quality outputs in any project that I undertake. 

As a leader, I have served in several student organizations, with my most recent tenure as the Executive President of the WTAMU African Student Organization culminating in the Outstanding Student Organization of the Year award - a testament to my commitment to community-building and service.

I am currently looking to contribute my extensive data analytics skills, business acumen, programming skills and leadership to drive data-driven decision-making. If you know of opportunities, or if you would simply like to engage in discussions about the future of technology, feel free to connect with me!
